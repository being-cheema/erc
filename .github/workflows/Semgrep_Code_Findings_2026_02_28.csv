The application should consider leverage ATS public key pinning to ensure that the application only communicates to serves with an allow-listed certificate (and public key). By default the device will allow connections if the default trust store (CA store) posesses the right certificates. The number of accepted Certificate Authorities by default is hundreds. Using public key pinning vastly reduces the attack surface.
